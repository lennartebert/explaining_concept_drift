# Explainable Concept Drift Framework

## Data
Synthetic and real-world datasets are used to validate the proposed framework.

Data is not shipped with this repository but can be downloaded online as instructed below. The pyhton script "unpack data.ipynb" helps with unpacking the data in the correct directory.

The following datasets are used:
    - Maaradji et al. 2013: 72 event logs with different kinds of concept drift. See their paper for description of different patterns. Reference: Dumas, M., La Rosa, M., Mendling, J., Reijers, H.A.: Fundamentals of Business Process Management. Springer (2013). 
        1. Download from https://data.4tu.nl/articles/dataset/Business_Process_Drift/12712436
        2. Specify the file path to the zip file in "unpack data.py".
        3. Execute "unpack data.ipynb"
        4. The extracted files should be placed in data/synthetic/maardji et al 2013
